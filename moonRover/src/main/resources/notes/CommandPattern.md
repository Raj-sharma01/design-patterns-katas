Benefits of the Command Pattern

1. Actions as Objects

Methods or operations can be converted into command objects.

These command objects can be passed around like data.

1.1 Decoupling Action from the Invoker

Example: In an editor, various commands (copy, paste, delete) can be encapsulated as command objects.

Previously, to allow another object to perform actions on the editor, the whole editor object had to be passed (which can be unsafe or lead to tight coupling).

Now, only the necessary command object needs to be passed, ensuring better encapsulation and safety.

2. History and Undo Support

Since all command objects implement the same interface or inherit from a common abstract class, they can be stored in a list.

This allows for maintaining a history of executed commands.

Enables features like Undo/Redo by re-executing or reversing commands.

3. Easier Batch Operations

Multiple command objects (each representing different operations) can be collected and invoked sequentially.

Useful for macro commands, scripting, or batch processing where heterogeneous operations are grouped and executed together.
